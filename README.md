- **Spell Checking:** Utilizes binary search and the Levenshtein distance algorithm to check the spelling of words.
- **Suggestions:** Provides suggestions for misspelled words based on similarity.
- **File Handling:** Supports loading and saving the dictionary from/to a text file.

## Usage
1. Compile and run the `Spell.java` file.
2. Use the text field to input words.
3. Click "Add to Dictionary" to add a word to the dictionary.
4. Click "Check" to check the spelling of a word.
