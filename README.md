# Spell Checker

This repository contains a Java program for a simple spell checker with a graphical user interface (GUI). The spell checker allows users to add words to a dictionary, check the spelling of a word, and provides suggestions for misspelled words.

## Features
- **Adding Words to Dictionary:** Users can add words to the dictionary, which is saved to a file for persistent storage.
- **Spell Checking:** Users can check the spelling of a word against the dictionary.
- **Suggestions for Misspelled Words:** If a word is misspelled, the program provides suggestions for corrections based on Levenshtein distance algorithm.
